# Extensions Sync

Synchronizes a list of your installed extensions to a JSON file.

This JSON file can then be shared across systems so that your all your VS Code instances share the same extensions.

The JSON file is stored in `<settings location>/Code/Users/globalStorage/georgevarghese185.extensions-sync/extensions.json`

`<settings location>` depends on [your OS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations)
